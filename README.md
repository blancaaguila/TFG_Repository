# TFG_Repository
(1) Corr.new.R -> Correlations measured for PCHi-C raw reads.

(2)cleanned_segmonk.R--> Script which removes the duplicates from a BAM file. 

(3) segmonk_reannotated.R --> reanotates HindIII fragments

(4) p53_calculatedistances.R ->  classifies interactions by distance or by P-P vs P-OE. 

(5) PCHiC_interaction_annotation.R -> (A) annotates non.captured hind III fragments. (B) Integrates interaction files with non.captured & captured Hind III annotated fragments. (C) Plot Sankey for multiple files (Iterate over multiple interaction files along the functions). 

(6) ORA_and_GSEA.R --> ORA and GSEA to find enriched genes in GO and KEGG. Heatmap of pluripotent and differential markers.
